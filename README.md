# 🦇 Bat-Tech Testing Suite 🦇

This repository contains tests for Batman's critical technology systems to ensure they function flawlessly in the fight against crime in Gotham City.

## 📁 Structure

- `bat_functions.py`: Core Batman technology functions
- `test_bat_functions.py`: Pytest test suite for the bat functions
- `.github/workflows/pytest.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration

## 🧪 Testing Approach

The test suite demonstrates:

1. **Basic pytest assertions** ✅ for simple function testing
2. **Parametrized tests** 🔄 to verify functions across multiple inputs
3. **Fixtures** 🔧 for reusable test data
4. **Mocking** 🎭 to simulate external dependencies without delays
5. **Continuous Integration** 🔄 via GitHub Actions

## 🚀 Running the Tests

To run the tests locally:

```bash
pytest
```

For a coverage report:

```bash
pytest --cov=.
```

## 🛠️ CI/CD

Tests automatically run on every push to the repository through GitHub Actions, ensuring that Batman's systems remain reliable at all times. 🦸‍♂️

## 🌃 Protecting Gotham

With these tests in place, Batman can focus on what he does best - keeping Gotham safe from villains like the Joker! 🃏
